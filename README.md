Start Debugging:

Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the left gutter of the editor (next to line numbers) or pressing F9.
Press F5 or click the green play button in the Debug view to start debugging.
VS Code will launch the program in debug mode and pause at the breakpoints you've set.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code:
Step Navigation:

Step Over (F10): Execute the current line of code and move to the next line.
Step Into (F11): Move into the function call on the current line (if applicable).
Step Out (Shift+F11): Continue execution until the current function exits.
Variables and Watch Expressions:

View and inspect local variables, watch expressions, and the call stack.
Modify variables during runtime to test different scenarios (Ctrl+Shift+Y to open the Debug Console for JavaScript/Node.js).
Debug Console:

Interact with the program through the Debug Console to execute commands or evaluate expressions in the context of your debug session.
Breakpoints:

Set conditional breakpoints based on expressions (F9 to toggle breakpoint) and log messages (console.log output appears in the Debug Console).
Debugging Control:

Pause (F5), resume (F5), stop (Shift+F5), restart, and detach debugging sessions as needed.
Integrated Terminal Integration:

Debugging sessions can interact with the integrated terminal for input and output, especially useful for applications that require user interaction or console-based debugging.
Exception Handling:

Configure how VS Code handles exceptions and uncaught errors during debugging sessions.
Multi-session Debugging:

Debug multiple processes or instances simultaneously, useful for client-server applications or distributed systems.


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
Install Git:

Ensure Git is installed on your computer. You can download and install Git from git-scm.com if you haven't already.
